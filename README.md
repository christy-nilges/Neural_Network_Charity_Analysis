# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks for this project, I used the features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that will help to predict if the applicants that will be funded by a Charitable organization called Alphabet Soup will be successful. For this analysis we had a dataset containing various measures on 34,000 organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup. This project compromised of the following 3 steps:
 - Preprocessing the data for the neural network
 - Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
 - Optimizing the model
